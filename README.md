## Here are some general tips for handling runtime errors:

**Check for index out of bounds errors**: If you're accessing elements in an array or a string, make sure you're not going out of bounds. For example, if you're accessing `s[end]` in the code you provided, make sure that `end` does not exceed the length of the string `s`.

**Check for division by zero errors**: If you're dividing by a variable, make sure that the variable is not zero.

**Check for null pointer errors**: If you're using pointers in your code, make sure they are not null before dereferencing them.

**Check for uninitialized variables**: Make sure that all variables are initialized before they are used.

**Use a debugger**: If you're still unable to find the cause of the runtime error, use a debugger to step through your code and see where the error occurs.
